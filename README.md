# grilledcheese
This project is an attempt to create the most delicious grilled cheese sandwich. Ever.

## Ingredients
* Two slices of bread (dealer's choice of variety)
* An assortment of cheeses where at least 50% is cheddar by mass (no "American Cheese)
* Guacamole
* Sriracha
* Dijon mustard
* Pre-cooked bacon
* Red tomato, sliced
* Fresh basil leaves

## Instructions
* If your cheeses aren't shredded and/or thinly sliced, do that first.
* Place non-stick pan on stovetop, turn up to a low to low/medium heat.
* Place butter in pan and melt it, maybe add a little garlic salt.
* Place piece of bread on the pan in the melted butter.
* Smear a layer of guacamole on top side of bread in pan.
* Add a layer of bacon, roughly covering the surface area of the bread.
* Add a thin layer of cheese on top of the bacon.
* Distribute slices of tomato until the bacon and cheese is roughly covered.
* Lay individual basil leaves flat over tomato slices until tomatoes are covered.
* Lay down a fairly irresponsible amount of cheese over top of the basil.
* Drizzle sriracha over top of the cheese to taste.
* Spread a thin layer of dijon mustard on one side of the unused piece of bread.
* Lay that slice mustard side down on top of the cheese.
* Periodically peek underneath of the sandwich. 
* When the bottom is golden brown, carefully lift it and add more butter to pan.
* Once melted, flip.
* Repeat until the second side is golden brown.
* Dish it out on a plate and let it cool for about two minutes before cutting into 2 or 4 slices.
